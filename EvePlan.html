        <p class="about">EvePlan is a full service event management firm based in Calgary,
             Alberta that was created by pairing together our passion for 
             business and events. We bring a fresh, unique approach to the event management industry.</p><br>
            
            <p>Our team understands that a properly executed event can be
             leveraged to support an organization’s strategic vision, 
             incorporated into a company’s marketing plan,
            or used to build networks and client loyalty.</p>

         <p class="text-big1">HOW IT WORKS</p><br>
         <p class="text-small1">LEARN: WE WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU</p><br>
         <p class="text-small2">What is your business about? What are your challenges? 
            What are the issues that your members or clients are dealing with?
             By thoroughly understanding your company’s leadership culture, how your organization
              operates and your long term strategic plans, we become a part of your team. Our model 
              works best when we can become more than the “hired help” and can become strategic event
               management partners, so the first step for us is about getting to know you and your business.

         </p><br>
         <p class="text-small1">BUILD: LET US DO THE HEAVY LIFTING.</p><br>
         <p class="text-small2">Because we have taken the time to learn about your business and the goals of your event,
             you can rest assured that the event will be on target and in line with your objectives. Leave the planning 
             and management to us. Let us look after the details and the heavy lifting that comes with planning a 
             professional event. From our network of preferred vendors, industry connections and years of experience,
              we can deliver a full service event management experience. The Spark team is well equipped to deliver a
              world class event, each and every time. Your job is to run your business; our job is to run your event.</p><br>
        <p class="text-small1">
            DELIVER: SIT BACK. RELAX.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-small2">
            Finally, this is where our event management expertise comes into play. At our core, we love events. We love 
            the on-site details, production plans, schedules, deadlines and to do lists that come along with managing an event. 
            From meticulous management of facility details to AV, catering and on-site coordination, we ensure every detail is
             looked after. Managing your event using a strategic overall plan and a methodical management approach allows you 
             to rest easy. Knowing that every last detail is looked after will allow you to focus on your attendees and stakeholders
              at the event. Let us look after the rest.
